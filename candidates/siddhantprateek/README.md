## Week 1

- Team Introduction: Introduce team members to each other, including their roles and responsibilities.
- Project Overview: Provide an overview of the project, its goals, and objectives.
Expectations and Goals: Set clear expectations for team members, clarify project goals, and ensure everyone is aligned.
- Setting up Communication Channels: Establish communication channels for the team to collaborate effectively (e.g., Slack, email, project management tools).
- Kick-off Meeting: Hold a kick-off meeting to discuss the project's scope, deliverables, and timeline.
- Project Planning: Initiate the project planning phase, including defining tasks, milestones, and dependencies.

## Week 2 

- Research and Background: Conduct any necessary research to gain a deeper understanding of the project domain. The team discussed the use case and identified the need for a consensus algorithm, specifically the Raft consensus algorithm. Raft Consensus Shortcomings: During discussions, the limitations of the Raft consensus algorithm were analyzed, highlighting potential areas for improvement.

- Considering Other Protocols: Apart from Raft, the team explored existing consensus protocols to determine if any other option might better suit the project requirements.

- Building Blocks of Performance Measurement: The team discussed the essential components required to measure the performance of the consensus algorithm effectively.

- Tool Setup: Set up necessary development and collaboration tools (e.g., version control, project management software, etc.).

## Week 3

- BFT Consensus Methods and Blockchain Interaction: Researched and examined existing Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus methods and their interaction with blockchain systems. Evaluated how BFT algorithms enhance the security and reliability of blockchain networks.

- Overview of Raft Consensus Algorithm: Provided a concise overview of the Raft consensus algorithm. Described its key components, including leader election, log replication, and safety properties. Understood the algorithm's role in achieving consensus in distributed systems.

- Benefits and Use Cases of Raft: Led a discussion on the benefits and use cases of the Raft algorithm within the context of Hyperledger projects. Emphasized its advantages, such as simplicity, fault tolerance, and ease of understanding. Explored potential applications in distributed ledgers, permissioned blockchains, and decentralized applications.

## Week 4

- Hyperledger Labs BDLS: Researched and obtained the necessary resources to install Hyperledger Labs BDLS, a distributed ledger system designed to work with various consensus algorithms.

- Mir-BFT Consensus: Explored the Mir-BFT consensus, an implementation of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, compatible with Hyperledger projects.

- Local Environment Setup: Installed and configured Hyperledger Labs BDLS and the Mir-BFT consensus on a local development environment for testing and analysis.

- Documentation: Documented the installation process, challenges faced (if any), and initial observations to serve as a reference for further analysis and reporting.
