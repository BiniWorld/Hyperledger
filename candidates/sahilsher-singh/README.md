## Week 1

```js
Date: July 3, 2023 - July 8, 2023
```

- Team Introduction: Introduce team members to each other, including their roles and responsibilities.
- Project Overview: Provide an overview of the project, its goals, and objectives.
Expectations and Goals: Set clear expectations for team members, clarify project goals, and ensure everyone is aligned.
- Setting up Communication Channels: Establish communication channels for the team to collaborate effectively (e.g., Slack, email, project management tools).
- Kick-off Meeting: Hold a kick-off meeting to discuss the project's scope, deliverables, and timeline.
- Project Planning: Initiate the project planning phase, including defining tasks, milestones, and dependencies.
- Start learning: The public blockchian and its consensus algorithms, as I don't have prior experience of it.

## Week 2 
```js
Date: July 10, 2023 - July 14, 2023
```

- Research and Background: Conduct any necessary research to gain a deeper understanding of the project domain. The team discussed the use case and identified the need for a consensus algorithm, specifically the Raft consensus algorithm. Raft Consensus Shortcomings: During discussions, the limitations of the Raft consensus algorithm were analyzed, highlighting potential areas for improvement.

- Onging journey of learning: Creating little projects to get fimilar with blockchain.

## Week 3

```js
Date: July 17, 2023 - July 21, 2023
```

- BFT Consensus Methods and Blockchain Interaction: Researched and examined existing Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus methods and their interaction with blockchain systems. Evaluated how BFT algorithms enhance the security and reliability of blockchain networks.

- Overview of Raft Consensus Algorithm: Provided a concise overview of the Raft consensus algorithm. Described its key components, including leader election, log replication, and safety properties. Understood the algorithm's role in achieving consensus in distributed systems.

- Raft Consensus Algorithm Limitations: Analyzed the limitations of the Raft consensus algorithm, including its inability to tolerate Byzantine faults. Identified potential areas for improvement.

- Hyperledger Labs BDLS: Explored Hyperledger Labs BDLS, a distributed ledger system designed to work with various consensus algorithms. Understood how it can be used to implement the Raft consensus algorithm.

- Architecture of Hyperledger Labs BDLS: Examined the architecture of Hyperledger Labs BDLS, including its components and their interactions. Understood how the Raft consensus algorithm is implemented in Hyperledger Labs BDLS (will be discussed in detail in the next week).

- Getting hands dirty: On the basis of my research, I started to create a little project to get a better understanding of the blockchain and its consensus algorithms. Also continuing my journey of further learning.

## Week 4

```js
Date: July 24, 2023 - July 28, 2023
```

- Public blockchain learning completed: : I have completed my learning of public blockchain and its consensus algorithms. I have also created a little project to get a better understanding of the blockchain and its consensus algorithms. Also created a little project to get a better understanding of the blockchain and its consensus algorithms.

- Start with Hyperledger Fabric: I have started to learn about Hyperledger Fabric and its consensus algorithms. Also continuing my journey of further learning.
