## Mentee Guide

This document serves as a report detailing the progress, tasks, and learning undertaken by the mentee during the course of their mentoring program. Each mentee is required to create a folder with their name as the folder name and include this README inside it. The README will contain a comprehensive report of their learning and accomplishments throughout the mentoring period.

```markdown
- Mentee's_Name
    - README.md (this file)
    - Task1_Report.md
    - Task2_Report.md
    - ...
    - TaskN_Report.md (if applicable)
    - Other_Resources (if applicable)
```

The mentee's main focus will be on creating detailed reports for each task or learning experience, saved as separate markdown (.md) files. These reports will provide insights into the activities performed, lessons learned, and any challenges faced during the tasks or learning sessions.
